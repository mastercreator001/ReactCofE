              description="The Singleton Adventure was one of the very first trips I have attended on The New Middle school and for me moving from West Street Primary as many others did as well it was a big move as was a trip away to somewhere not local. Singleton for me was in 1Hawes  and the trip was fun and exciting and lots of places to run around. I couldn't tell you the weather or what I learn't but it was all part of getting older and making progress into the adult I have become.  <br/> <br/>
              
              Singlteon or as it later became known as The Weald And Downland Living And Open Air Museum is a unique place in the city of Chichester and hopefully you remember you trip away with the school.<br/><br/>

If possible the building isn't even dismantled and will be moved as close to whole as it safely can. <br/> <br/>
              
              The collection covers all types of builiding school houses public meeting bulidings and offices of sorts schools are amoung their collections. The overall site is themed and has allowed for a collective of similur aged buildings to be hosted near to each other. The site spans 40 acres and is the only living museum with such a extensive collection in the United Kingdom. "

The public building you see in the image is an old town hall that was rescued from Titchfield and it used to be a Market Hall which would otherwise continued to be either removed via demolition or collapse through natural decay and neglect.<br/></br>
              
              
BUILDING HISTORYTOP 3 INTERESTING FACTS
Market halls like this were once general throughout England. Among the earliest which have survived are several from the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The majority were timber-framed.

Many were demolished in the 18th and 19th centuries, since they no longer served the purpose for which they were built and were occupying space needed for other uses. Many others were replaced by more solid buildings, with enclosed rooms taking the place of the open arcade. One by one they were transformed, lost, or, in a few cases, moved to a less valuable site.

This was the fate of the Titchfield Market Hall in the middle of the last century â€” some two and a half centuries after it was first built."

I'm afraid I dont remember the worksheets we had to use or fill out but perhaps you do and could let me know what you remember about the trip. If like me it was one of your first school trips off the Island how did it go for you? apphrension or worry or totaly fine I'd be interested to hear."

As you can see in the picture you can observe on the foreground lots of open space and the ability for the park to operate and seclude lots of different properties and they have been arranged thus so with a fair amount of spacing between to allow for the casual visitor to be encapsulated amoung one peried of house and them from a short walk to be transported into another age."

              description="In the picture you can see one of the properties that used a form of foundation placed on all four corner on essentially giant mushrooms. No really that is what they llok like but in reality they were used to keep mice or rodents out from getting to food stuffs within the barn. Generally in a subsistance economy or a small towwn the abilities held within the local community were essential for the totality of the village. Generally you might have a baker and repairer a blacksmith etc but also it could be in another town and this would require a special trip. <br/> <br/> Subsistance living was tough and cleary sitting in bed wasnt an option so naturally you needed somethinng to trade hence the more skills your villagers had the better they coped as the more complec thing you could do the more you were compensated.

Historically the building are beyond measure as it all seems to be buildings of note mixed woth ramshackle buildings that no one card about. Lovingly restored it is a amazing feat to visit the site as sonn as you appreciate the diverse collection and the centuries spanned you soon realise the history preserved. "
