              description="The Singleton Adventure was one of the very first trips I have attended on The New Middle school and for me moving from West Street Primary as many others did as well it was a big move as was a trip away to somewhere not local. Singleton for me was in 1Hawes  and the trip was fun and exciting and lots of places to run around. I couldn't tell you the weather or what I learn't but it was all part of getting older and making progress into the adult I have become.  <br/> <br/>
              
              Singlteon or as it later became known as The Weald And Downland Living And Open Air Museum is a unique place in the city of Chichester and hopefully you remember you trip away with the school.<br/><br/>
              
              As you can see in the image there is a recreation of an old school as it would have been  in the late 1800 or early 1900's"

              The collection covers all types of builiding school houses public meeting bulidings and offices of sorts schools are amoung their collections. The overall site is themed and has allowed for a collective of similur aged buildings to be hosted near to each other. The site spans 40 acres and is the only living museum with such a extensive collection in the United Kingdom. "

The public building you see in the image is an old town hall that was rescued from Titchfield and it used to be a Market Hall which would otherwise continued to be either removed via demolition or collapse through natural decay and neglect.<br/></br>
              
              
BUILDING HISTORYTOP 3 INTERESTING FACTS
Market halls like this were once general throughout England. Among the earliest which have survived are several from the late 15th and early 16th centuries. The majority were timber-framed.

Many were demolished in the 18th and 19th centuries, since they no longer served the purpose for which they were built and were occupying space needed for other uses. Many others were replaced by more solid buildings, with enclosed rooms taking the place of the open arcade. One by one they were transformed, lost, or, in a few cases, moved to a less valuable site.

This was the fate of the Titchfield Market Hall in the middle of the last century â€” some two and a half centuries after it was first built."

I'm afraid i dont remember the worksheets we had to use or fill out but perhps you do and could let me know what you remember about the trip. If like me it was one of your forst school trips off the Island how did it go for you? apphrension or worry or totaly fine I'd be interested to hear."
